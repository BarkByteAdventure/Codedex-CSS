<!--# What are selectors?
- are used to determine which HTML element(s) get styled
- most common type of selector is the type selector (selects all matching elements on the page for styling)

For example:

div {
  /* Styles go here. */
}

- whatever declarations we replace the comments with are applied to every div element

# Class and ID Selectors

- can select elements by their HTML attributes

The following example selects elements with a class of "class-name" or an id of "id-name":

.class-name {
  /* Styles go here. */
}

#id-name {
  /* Styles go here. */
}

- Selecting by class is done with a . period
    -> used to style multiple elements with a matching class attribute
    
- Selecting by id is done with an # period
    ->used to style a single element with a matching id attribute

div.class-name {
  /* Styles go here. */
}

div#id-name {
  /* Styles go here. */
}
